       <p> This is my developer story. 
        As a child, my family had one laptop to share. My siblings and I only used it for school purposes. 
        While in school, we learned how to use Microsoft Word but never anything else. 
        I became faster and faster at typing because of the amount of essays we had to write in school. In college, I nearly had to  type out around 3-4  essays a week. 
        I saved up for 5 years before I was able to purchase my first computer. It felt like a dream.
        I decided to take this course to help me build a website. I would like to build a website to help me build my career in media marketing. </p>
